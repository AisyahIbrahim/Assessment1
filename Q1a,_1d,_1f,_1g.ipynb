        "One day while wandering around a clothing store at KL East Mall, you stumbled upon a person who is choosing a dress for Hari Raya. It turns out that the person is visually impaired and had a hard time distinguishing between an abaya and a kebaya. To help people with the similar situation, you then decided to develop an AI system to identify the type of clothes using a Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet). In order to train the network, you decide to use the Fashion MNIST dataset which is freely available on Pytorch.\n"
